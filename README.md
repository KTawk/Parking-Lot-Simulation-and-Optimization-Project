# Parking-Lot-Simulation-and-Optimization-Project
This project was developed as part of the ITI 1121 - Introduction to Computing II course at the University of Ottawa. The goal of the project is to simulate a parking lot and determine the optimal number of parking spots needed to avoid excessive queue build-up, using probabilistic models, specifically a triangular distribution, to simulate car arrivals and departures.


Project Overview

I developed a parking lot simulator in Java, which simulates car arrivals and departures based on triangular distribution. The simulation helps determine the optimal number of parking spots required to prevent long queues at the entrance, ensuring efficient use of parking spaces without over-provisioning.


Features

Simulates car arrivals and departures using probabilistic models.
Uses triangular distribution to model car parking duration and departure times.
Optimizes parking lot capacity for varying car arrival rates.
Ensures efficient utilization of parking resources while minimizing queues.
